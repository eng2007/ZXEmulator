This game has been described as Jetpac underwater.

Game Improvements
1) Keys changed to N,M instead of M,SymShift for ease of use
2) Protek support changed to Sinclair joystick support
3) Bug when selecting joystick with no Kempston attached now fixed.
   This was required to support improvement #2

Tech Notes
1) The game relies on sysvar TV_FLAG bit 0 being set when started, so
 the green seabed is printed at bottom of screen (channel #0;AT 1,0).
 This gets cleared at $822C, which means future prints go to #2.
 This has been changed to PRINT AT 23,0 which works with the miniROM.
2) The original also does a dummy fire when starting a level!
