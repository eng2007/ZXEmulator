Tech Notes
>The ZX Printer screen copy has only been tested on an emulator.
>The COPY routine has been slightly modified from the original ZX-ROM routine.
>The screen print routine in the game is extremely complex! (It draws the picture boxes as well as the proportional font text)
>The code loaded from tape is encrypted. It immediately decrypts a smaller subset of itself before running, and it is this subset which is used to make the ROM image.
