Tech Notes
>This game was originally too big to fit into 16K. However, several techniques have been used to squeeze everything in, and I've noted them in the separate 'compression notes' document for general amusement.
>If you can hear a high pitch noise whilst the speech samples are playing then this is a fault with your emulator as real hardware filters out these high frequencies.

Tips when playing the game
1) If the computer is serving, the game waits for you to press fire.
2) The difficulty levels on the main menu screen are based on the original Spectrum keys. For blue you'd press '1', red='2', yellow='6' and white='7'. Once you've selected a colour press Enter to continue.
