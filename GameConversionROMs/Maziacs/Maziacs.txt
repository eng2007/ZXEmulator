Game Improvements
1) BASIC now compiled
2) Cheat options included.
 At the start of the game, the DK'tronics logo will flash.
 Hold down one or more of the following keys to enable cheats:
"F" - always win fights. You can still starve to death though.
"S" - increase game speed (unfortunately the Maziacs also move faster)
3) Pressing BREAK doesn't crash the machine

Bug Fixes
1) Trying to continue a game when one hasn't been started is captured,
 but sends you back into the keys/level menu. If you press K or G then
 you will select the redefine keys/level option, but there'll be no text
 on the screen.

Tech Notes
1) The game contained m/c in BASIC REM statements. These are kept at the
same address for compatability.
2) The game has the value of CHARS hardcoded into it. As CHARS has been
moved for ZXC2/3 compatability, the values have also been changed.

Change history
1.0 - Initial release
1.1 - Modified for ZXC2/3 compatibility
1.2 - Bugfix involving inkey$ and joystick option
