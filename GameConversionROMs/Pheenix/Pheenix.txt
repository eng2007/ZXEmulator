Converted to 16K ROM cartridge by Jimmy Smith, 2020

Improved by changing the AGF joystick option to ZX Interface 2. Also squeezed both the English and Spanish versions in 
(press CAPS SHIFT at reset to select Spanish). This ROM is based on the original release and not the re-release under the Alternative Software label.
