Tech notes
>The game relies on the dashboard being loaded in as a second screen$, it will never redraw it. The original map was too complex to compress well so it has been redrawn using simple block characters.
>This is the largest game to be compressed onto a cartridge - the original game code is 40881 bytes long, and the dashboard screen (bottom half of screen - not just a third!) is also required.
>There are no spare bytes in this image! The new map goes right up to $3FFF.
