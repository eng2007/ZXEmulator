Tech notes
>This game had to "diet" in order for the compression to fit. The entire 16K space is used.
>The game uses the original ZX charset only at the start. As the game font doesn't contain lower case letters or punctuation, so the message has been changed into uppercase.
>The game contains several lookup tables (see $F100 onwards). These are now generated via code to save space.
>The game now uses IM1 to save space.
>The control option names have changed in order to save space.
