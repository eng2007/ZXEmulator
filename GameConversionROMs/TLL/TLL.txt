Tech Notes
1) The game originally also called ROM routines to CLS and set the 
 border - these have been changed to alternative routines.
2) The start of the game has been modified to beep first then change
 the lower message - it works better for this cartridge version
3) The game originally used IM2 with the wrap-around method of jumping
 to a routine. It also used IM1 at times. The game now remains in IM1
 and redirects to a user-defined routine.
