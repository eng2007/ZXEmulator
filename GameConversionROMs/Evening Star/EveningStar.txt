Evening Star
Hewson Consultants Ltd, 1987
48K Spectrum
Converted to 16K ROM cartridge by Jimmy Smith, 2021

Enhancements:
- Sped up some of the graphics routines (mainly LDIR sections). However as the game is frame-rate limited so the difference won't be noticed.
- Improved the tape loading routines as if there was an error (or a random block of code was loaded) the game would generally malfunction. Now it loops until a correct size block has loaded without error.
