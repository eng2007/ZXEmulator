Game improvements
1) Removed bright attribute squares around hostages
2) Hold down 'F' key during reset until a beep is heard to speed
   up drawing routines (slightly)
3) Hold down 'S' key during reset until a beep is heard to
   swap up/down keys so it feels more like a flight simulator!
   (The joystick options in the original already swap up/down)

Tech notes
This game doesn't use the ROM beeper routine as it contains it's own copy.
The game uses the original ZX charset only at the start. As the game font doesn't contain lower case letters or punctuation, the original ZX charset has been imported. Thankfully there's enough space in the ROM to do this.
