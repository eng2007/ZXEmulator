Converted to 16K ROM cartridge by Jimmy Smith, 2021

The game has been improved to support Fuller and Sinclair joysticks, which required modification to the game because at some locations in the game you couldn't use up/down with left/right, which meant you had to be pixel perfect to move across onto some platforms. Since the game compressed well, the loading screen in also been included.
