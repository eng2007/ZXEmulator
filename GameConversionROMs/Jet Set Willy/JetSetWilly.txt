Game improvements
1) Includes official Software Projects bugfix pokes
2) Turbo mode - game plays faster!
3) Customise game from a selection of 4 built-in POKEs
4) Supports Sinclair, Fuller and Timex joysticks
5) Bugfixes - for the pause IN0 bug and corrupted conveyor bitmaps.
6) Save wear and tear of your tape inlay - Padlock protection removed (needed the space)

Tips when playing game:
If you find it too hard use the POKE options.
If you find it too easy try it in TURBO mode.

Tech Notes
>The Kempston auto-detection routine has been removed. You have to manually select it from the 'controls' option.
>This game runs with interrupts disabled, so it is sensitive to length of keyboard/joystick routines.
These have been modified to include additional delays, so all methods take the same CPU time.
>Thanks to Skoolkid for his excellent JSW disassembly - It made modifying the game a lot easier and provided a good source of POKEs to use.
>The game compresses well, but is larger than Manic Miner so once the character set and ROM header are added there is little free space.
>This is the first game to use double ZX0 compression, ie: the first .zx0 file is compressed to make a .zx0.zx0 file. In this case it saves an additional 90 bytes.
