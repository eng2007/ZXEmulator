Winged Warlords
CDS Microsystems, 1983
16K Spectrum
Converted to 16K ROM cartridge by Jimmy Smith, 2020

This conversion uses a "mini OS" replacement to provide the RST 10 and keyboard services. Included support for various joystick options that the original game never did. Translated the BASIC program that handled the menu code and drew 
the game screen into machine code.
