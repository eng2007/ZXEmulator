None

Tech Notes:
1) Typing certain names in hi-score table would show a hidden
   message. These have been removed to save space and fit into 16K
2) Typing in MAAAAH on the hi-score table still works though.
3) Typing in your name when getting a hi-score is hard work, even on the original. It works much better on the 128K version.
