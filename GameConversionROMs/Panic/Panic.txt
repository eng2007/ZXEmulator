Panic
Mikro-Gen Ltd, 1983
16K Spectrum
Converted to 16K ROM cartridge by Jimmy Smith, 2020

Modified the game to support Fuller joysticks as well as rearranging the keys to support Interface II port 1 joystick by default. The hi-score routine now also supports joystick input. There are several versions of the game - both Mikro-Gen and Visions releases. This ROM is based of the main Visions version.
