Draughts Genius
Rack-It, 1987
48K Spectrum
Converted to 16K ROM cartridge by Jimmy Smith, 2021

The game originally wouldn't fit into 16K, so the intro sequence has been removed. The main game itself is complete. A start-up page has been added giving publisher info and listing which keys to use, with clarification that a double-click is required to confirm a move whilst playing.
