Game improvments:
1) Includes cheat options. Reset the computer, hold down one or more of the
following keys to activate the cheat. Release the keys once the main menu appears.
"L" - infinite lives
"T" - infinite time
"I" - immunity - note this can cause screen corruption. If you scroll past the bottom
 of one level you will enter the next, and eventually start displaying the game code!
 It is also possible to get stuck in one location.

Game tips:
1) If you can't get past level 1 and are at the bottom of the slope,
then try touching the magenta diamonds at the bottom left of the screen
2) Pressing fire when using Sinclair or Cursor joysticks will abort
the game as the '0' key is the hard-coded abort key.
