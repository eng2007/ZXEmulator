If you find it too easy try it in TURBO mode.

Tech Notes
>The Kempston auto-detection routine has been removed. You have to manually select it from the 'controls' option.
>This game runs with interrupts disabled, so it is sensitive to length of keyboard/joystick routines.
These have been modified to include additional delays, so all methods take the same CPU time.
>Thanks to Skoolkid for his excellent Manic Miner disassembly - It made modifying the game a lot easier and provided a good source of POKEs to use.
>The game compresses well, so there is still >700 bytes (in smaller blocks) of spare space for extra features.
>ASCII character 126 has been repurposed as n+~ for use in Spanish text. The charset has also been moved up to support ZXC2/ZXC3.
